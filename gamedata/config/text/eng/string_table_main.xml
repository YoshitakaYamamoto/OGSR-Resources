		<text>Fox asked me to find a briefcase he had dropped and take it to Sidorovich. It contains some old papers that had been stolen from the army roadblock. When making his request Fox behaved in such a manner, as if he did not care at all. One man show, damn... He said the case was behind the southern outpost's fence, near a toilet and a heap of rubbish. Man, he couldn't have found a "better" place to drop it off...</text>

        	<text>Hm... interesting... Nothing special, but it sheds some more light on the matter... It looks like not all the docs are here. There must be another briefcase somewhere with the rest of them. Here's a small present for your trouble, Marked One. And tell Fox... No, better I get in touch with him myself.</text>

        	<text>Hey, Marked One, there're some docs I've happened to filch from the military outpost. Would you care to take them to Sidorovich? But... I have dropped off the briefcase when scarpering from those... And I really am to meet one guy here, so I cannot leave. Can you fetch it? It's behind the southern outpost's fence. You only have to slip accurately across the minefield, get behind the wire via the tree-trunk over there, then along the fence to a pile of garbage... There's a toilet nearby, so you won't miss the place - you'll sense it, ha-ha... Sidorovich is quite interested in those papers, so you won't regret the efforts!</text>

        	<text>You see, Marked One, I need some papers to be carried to Sidorovich... The problem is, the briefcase has been dropped off when I was scarpering from those... And I really am to meet one guy here, so I cannot leave. Can you fetch it? It's not far from here, by the cross that sticks up in the field over there. Sidorovich is quite interested in those papers, so you won't regret the efforts!</text>
