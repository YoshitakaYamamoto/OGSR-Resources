Ace can have a higher value, in our case, the ace - 11 points.\nMaximum bet - 5000, minimum bet - 500. That's all, nothing complicated.</text>

I don't like him, to be honest - he kills too quickly and the crowd doesn't like that. So, go and show us what you can do!

They were paired up intentionally as they hate each other's guts so don't worry about them working as a team - they're more likely to shoot each other. Today is rifle day so don't let them get too close or we'll have to pick you up piece by piece. The odds are 10:1 so if you win you'll make a fair amount. Off you go!</text>

They haven't fought yet but they're brothers, so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team, they're contenders for the final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun - be very careful with him.

You'll get a vest used by Freedom - it's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers aren't whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

		<text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took them at night so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all going to be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive, they'll go in the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here.

		<text>Okay.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_131">
		<text>Well, Marked One, all that remains now, is to turn off the "brain scorcher" and open a passage to the North. Are you ready to go?</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1312">
		<text>I'm ready.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_13121">
		<text>Well then, Marked One, you have the prototype protective helmet to protect yourself from the brain scorcher. The coordinates to the bunker, I know. Don't forget that the prototype can't protect you indefinitely from the radiation. You should get into the bunker under the antennas, and disable the scorcher as quickly as possible. I don't know what will happen next, but I feel that it's worth it! I know for one thing for sure - the road to the centre of the Zone will be open.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1313">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1314">
		<text>All you have to do - is to get to the bunker under the antennas and disable them. All clear?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1315">
		<text>Clear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1316">
		<text>Yes, there's another thing! The leader of Duty, I marked him on the map, needs a volunteer to perform some task at a the Army Warehouses, if you're interested, you can go and see him. I'll arrange with security to let you in.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_132">
		<text>No, I'm not ready yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1321">
		<text>Well get ready, Marked One! This task can't wait!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_151">
		<text>OK, the documents you brought from the Institute make some things a little clearer but we're still missing the info we need to get a full picture. A lab designated X18 is mentioned and its description matches the abandoned underground vaults in the Dark Valley. Looks like you'll have to go there and get the info we need. The lab is closed and you'll need two electronic keys to get inside. I'll give you one but you'll have to get the other one from Borov in the Dark Valley.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1511">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15111">
		<text>All you have to do is acquire the second key to Lab X18, get inside and retrieve the second batch of documents. Don't forget to get yourself a protective suit or you won't have a chance in hell of getting to the lab. So, will you do it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15112">
		<text>I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15113">
		<text>Great! I'll be waiting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15114">
		<text>No, I don't want to do it yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_15115">
		<text>Up to you but remember: this is the only way that can help us open the road to the North.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_161">
		<text>What do you want, Marked One?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_162">
		<text>Hey, Marked One! Times change but you're still grumpy and aloof. Here, take a seat, have a drink - maybe you'll mellow a bit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_171">
		<text>So, Marked One, you brought the documents from X18?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_172">
		<text>Yeah. Here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_1721">
		<text>Good, the situation is becoming clearer. As I expected this Brain Scorcher is man-made. It's a Kaymanov experimental emitter and its components were manufactured in the X18. These documents refer to the X16 lab where they sent some components. According to this, the X16 is located in the production complex area by Lake Yantar. The scientists have set up a mobile lab around there so maybe they can help.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_17211">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_17212">
		<text>The situation is difficult: You need to get to the scientists and find out where the X16 is so you can get the missing documents. So, you up for it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_17213">
		<text>Yeah.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_172131">
		<text>Great! I'll be waiting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_17214">
		<text>No, I'm not ready yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_172141">

		<text>No.</text>

		<text>No, I haven't got the documents yet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_211">
		<text>That's not good, Marked One, not good at all... You understand how much we need them, don't you? We need them real bad, believe me. The Brain Scorcher is right under our noses but we don't even know what it is! Go get the documents right now - we'll talk after that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_2111">

	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_start_221">
		<text>Great work, Marked One! We have the documents at last. I need to have a look at them now and maybe I'll work out how to get North. While I do that, if you have problems with money, you can fight at the Arena. The owner of the Arena is Arnie, I've uploaded his coordinates.</text>

		<text>What do you know about a stalker they call Ghost?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_41">
		<text>He's one of Strelok's men. They say he can sneak in anywhere without being noticed. I heard that he took out the leader of some crazy group... what was the name? Ah, 'Last Days', that's the one. They were pretty wild those boys... Oh, by the way, I heard that Ghost is doing some job for the scientists, so if you're looking for him try the mobile lab at Lake Yantar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_51">

	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111">
		<text>This legend is about the Monolith, which may be what caused the Zone to appear. When the Zone exploded in 2006, they evacuated people living near it and the Zone itself was cordoned off by the Army. Everyone was panicking, nobody knew what was going on, the Zone was expanding and the field labs couldn't do anything! Loads of people died there. Everyone was afraid of the radiation which could affect half of Europe. After a few years had passed, some reckless guys like you appeared. They called themselves stalkers. They started to sneak past army cordons believing that there are things in the Zone that would make them rich. Bit by bit, they brought out weird things, artefacts and which eventually turned out a race for them. Scientists went after them like crazy. They paid fantastic money for just one trinket back then, not like now.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811111">
		<text>After a while, the first tales and legends about what's deep inside the Zone by the tumbledown nuclear power plant started to circulate. It was also then that one of the veterans told us the story of Monolith that allegedly grants your wishes. You should have seen the hysteria: experienced, level-headed men started trying to break through to the centre - everyone wanted something from the Monolith.

		<text>When the Zone had just appeared many people were trapped inside and cut off from the outside world. Most of them died pretty quickly but there were a few lucky survivors who tried to do something about it. One of these survivors found himself by the station and noticed some strange light inside. With no way back he decided to try to get closer. He saw the broken roof of the sarcophagus and the light coming out through it. He climbed up the wall and looked inside. Among the debris of metal and molten concrete there lay a massive black rock. It was the Monolith. The stalker managed to shake off the "spell" and realised that he had climbed very close to the sarcophagus, which was highly radioactive. He was scared to death but through the fear he could sense the Monolith calling to him. The Monolith called to him and he came to see strange, unbelievable things about the Monolith inside his head...</text>

		<text>Yes Marked One, I do have... Incidentally, have you found any unusual bolts? They are the same as normal bolts which each stalker uses, only they shine in the dark as if illuminated from within. Fuck knows what other properties they possess besides luminescence... Well, there was a person, whose identity shall remain unknown, who came to me recently, he told me he was part of an expedition of scientists who had dug up such a bolt, somewhere. He was sure that obviously, there were more of these, not just one. Generally, I'm taking orders for 20 bolts at least, if you find more - great, bring them to me, but for lots of 20 bolts, you'll be well compensated... let's say, 30 thousand.

		<text>Sure, no problem! Freedom is one of the oldest groups in the Zone and the only one that openly opposes government troops and research teams. Its founders are dead - they were killed during a big bloodbath after the army dropped a large assault force in the Zone but the ability to control the Zone from outside was destroyed at the same time. There is some evidence to suggest that the first Zone was used as a secret army weapons' testing site. If that's true, they must have used some powerful shit.Anyway, what was I saying...? Oh yeah, Freedom is the only group that is trying to stop the government from gaining control over the testing site again. God knows what will happen if they start testing their shit again, so Freedom is trying to hold out at all costs.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_visitors_10_start_7111">
		<text>Useful to a rookie? Well, listen up. To the North, not far from the Brain Scorcher, Freedom have set up their HQ in an old military base. They're notorious nihilists, anarchists and criminals - freedom fighters, freaking guerrillas all of them. All they do is sabotage research groups, attack army units and constantly skirmish with Duty. These skirmishes are now spilling over into a small-scale war for survival. Let me give you some advice: never get involved with them. They'll only accept you if you're totally crazy and there's a reward on your head. Ha-ha-ha. Can you believe that?</text>

		<text>Can you tell me anything that would be useful to a rookie?</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_visitors_12_start_7111">
		<text>Well, there used to be this group led by Strelok. There were all sorts of legends about it going around the Zone... good and bad, but few people really knew the truth. The truth is that they wanted to deal with the Zone, find out what created it. That's why military stalkers were after them but they didn't know where to look. The government didn't want normal stalkers to know things they shouldn't have known. One day Strelok found something really important and made a move towards the centre of the Zone with some of his boys. Half of the group died on the way but the rest made it through... What happened to them there - no one knows. Looks like they've copped it. The other group members were caught and killed off... I don't think there are any of them left now. Sad story, eh?</text>

		<text>The mercenaries are kind of like Freedom, only worse. At least Freedom have some ideals, but these dogs, they'll do anything for money.

We were half-way through the sector, when the Scorcher suddenly switched on again. Spotty passed out straight away and fell down the hillside. I panicked and said that we should leave everything and go back. Hunchback managed to pull himself together and said that we had to get Spotty out... I said "You're an idiot, don't you want to live? It's over for him, how are we going to carry him all the way back?" Just as he managed to convince me and started to climb down to get Spotty... another wave came.

One came to a Duty outpost some time ago and a crowd gathered to look at him. Someone even recognized him...

		<text>Traders say that there's a real treasure trove of artefacts in the centre of the Zone, so anyone who makes it through will make enough money for two lifetimes. Personally, I think there's more to this. Obviously the traders think about their own interests, but there are strange rumours going around. Apparently, there's something better than artefacts there - something that isn't from this world, something alien or from another dimension altogether! They call it the Wish-granting machine. I heard a legend about a stalker who made it through. Only every time someone makes a wish the Zone grows and nobody who gets there uses his wish to make it disappear. I guess when you get to the Machine you don't give a shit about anyone else.</text>

	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_0">
		<text>I'd like to know something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1">
		<text>What do you want to know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_11">
		<text>Who are you and how did you end up here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_111">
		<text>My name is Kruglov. I am a professor of biology, I study the Zone. Yesterday, for example, I found an animal of particular interest - Anthropomorphous Dendroctonus Vulgaris. I mostly find and document new species of mutant animals, their traits and distinctive features. The information is then thoroughly studied and transferred to the outside world. Some of it, of course, goes to Barkeep. My discoveries have helped to save the lives of many stalkers. I was just transporting the results of my latest research to the laboratory near Lake Yantar when the helicopter came under fire.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12">
		<text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_121">
		<text>The Zone is a wonderful gift to humanity. Of course normal existence here is not possible due to the high radiation levels, and aggressive mutants. All of these things are obviously extremely dangerous but they are also things of great scientific value. The Zone is almost a natural experiment, a treasure for scientists! The extent to which humanity's knowledge could be increased through the study of the Zone is unfathomable. Technology, medicine, new plants- medical and edible, biotechnology, cures for incurable diseases...anything! Perhaps we can solve the food problem for the entire planet. If people didn't interfere, science could lead humanity into a new Golden Era!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1211">
		<text>Duty thinks otherwise and even Freedom doesn't seem to want to help you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12111">
		<text>They're simply incapable of grasping the whole picture. Their "here and now" problems are far more important to them than the future of humanity!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_1212">
		<text>Maybe there is some use in studying the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_12121">
		<text>So you understand that too? It's wonderful to discover that there are those among you who are not narrow-minded practical people. I've always said it's important to look at the whole set of issues from a broader perspective, to distance ourselves from the simple human measures. Even if the Zone has done harm to humanity, it can still be of great use to us!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_13">
		<text>Why are the mercenaries looking for this information?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_ecolog_crush_professor_give_info_dp_131">
		<text>I hope this doesn't offend you, but many stalkers are like children. They are seriously affected by things they find out. Just think of all these legends about a Monolith that grants wishes. What a joke! The problem is that these children play their games with real weapons and cause death. Childish people are often annoyed about the fact that someone doesn't share everything with them, including information that is not meant for them. There are no limits in the use of force. They shoot without thinking and kill those who study the Zone. They believe that this information will allow them to open the way to the centre of the Zone. They're fools, dangerous and naive fools!</text>

One day he came to me and said that he was leaving to join the monolith, and asked me to pray for his happiness. He left me all his money and artefacts. He said that if he didn't return the following week for his property, to use it to treat the stalkers beer. Well, I treating you. </text>

		<text>I have a certain amount of SQ109, it's generally an anti-TB drug, but it also shows great efficiency against this type of bacteria, your infection has not developed fully yet, first we will prick you - it will provide a better chance of success. Roll up your sleeve, Marked One.</text>

		<text>It's like this. Just as I thought. This artefact is actively live and breeding methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

	</string>
	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_uley_dialog_1_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Well, it seems he went to the Dark Valley, he was very pleased with himself, and probably was going to boast about his prize. Try to go there, judging by how quickly the guys started getting sick, this thug couldn't have lasted long.</text>

	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_uley_dialog_1_1_1_1">
		<text>Damn, how will I find him now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_uley_dialog_1_1_1">
		<text>Shit, so it's because of that... Now I understand, how it happened... We  were on our way to the Bar with a bag of artefacts. Near the entrance, Vasya Katchalov, a local criminal, bailed us up. I didn't want to hand it over, I'm not really a fighter, and the guys were already unable to even lift up their arms. In short, I gave him this artefact so he would leave us alone. Bloody hell, he's probably dead by now, if this artefact is causing the disease. So, it's necessary to find this nit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_uley_dialog_1_1">
		<text>Well, it looks like your guys are sick because of it. It carries a dangerous infection. Where is it now?</text>

		<text>What about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_uley_dialog_0">
		<text>Hey, about this strange artefact...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Is there really someone not afraid to visit us?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Who are you? Why do sit here and not in the Bar?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Why, aren't you aware? I thought, everybody at the Bar knew... These stalkers are sick. I want to warn you: They are struck down with an infection unknown to science, so accordingly, there is no vaccine against it. If you value your life, you'd better get out of here as soon as possible if you do not want to catch it yourself!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Thank you for your concern. Aren't you afraid of getting infected?</text>

		<text>Oops! Got it, just leaving!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>I'm - a scientist. The life of the scientist doesn't belong to him, it belongs to science... I specialize in microbiology, I study the framework of the mutations of viruses and bacteria under the influence of anomalous fields and intense radioactive exposure in the Zone. These stalkers - are a unique case, they must be studied. In addition, I may be also able to help them even. Well, you can't underestimate how important an accurate observation of the course of the disease and the description of the symptoms, will be to science! Of course, Dr.Gorbovsky was more  deeply involved in the study of this disease, I was only his assistant... And frankly, I just don't know what to do now! Without the doctor, I wouldn't be able to finish the studies or cure these two patients.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Where is Dr.Gorbovsky?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>Oh, the news about him is not good! I think, he was kidnapped by mercenaries! Perhaps they confused him for Professor Sakharov, because there are some similarities between them... The doctor was abducted three days ago, and a ransom note was sent. The amount asked by the kidnappers, is huge! So... I don't know what to do. Had he not been kidnapped, he most certainly would have managed to create a cure for this disease.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Why didn't you seek help from Duty, for example?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>Because I wasn't allowed to go to Duty! They were afraid that I was infected by my patients. If not for me, these poor creatures would have been shot long ago! These poor men are in a terrible state, they rave about a Klondike Artefact...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>I think that I should deal with these mercenaries.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>I doubt very much that there is something you can do, they looked like a team of well trained professionals.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_13">
		<text>Just give me their coordinates, and I'll take a look. Maybe I'll come up with something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_14">
		<text>But you can't cope with them alone! Perhaps, you should ask for help! The mercenaries are in the Darkscape. At least, that's where we were told to bring the ransom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_15">
		<text>Clear. Another question: How much time do I have?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_start_dialog_phrase_16">

	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_start_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>I was at the Garbage with the Falcon and Tikhon! They're just about to kick the bucket, but I feel fine. The doctor looks after them, and I drag food from Bar and drive the away dogs. Perhaps, some fresher guys will come.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_start_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>They found some hole in one of garbage heaps and made a cache there. Then they decided to return in a few months, and a few weeks ago - they asked me to accompany them, so I agreed.  I had to climb into this hole, with a bag of artefacts - there was even a rare one, I never even heard of! And then, as began to return to the Bar, the guys began to get sick, - I practically had to drag them the last few metres. I thought, they would receive treatment here, but it never happened...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_start_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Well?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgoy_pomoshnik_start_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Duty they saw them, coughing and spitting blood, they trained their guns at us and ordered us to leave. "Don't bring your diseases here!" - they said. Well, it's good that someone noticed and called the doctor, not that he could help us!</text>

	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_start_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>I was on my way to the poor sick fellows, but some animal picked up my scent! I hide here and sit and wait - maybe it will go away?</text>

	<string id="izgioy_doctor_start_dialog_phrase_6">

		<text>So, it was a bloodsucker? I'll make sure to record in my diary the strange sounds these creatures emit while on the hunt... Yes, of course! Let's go to the sick right now! I hope they are still alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_second_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>You were almost just eaten, and you talk about... "Amusing sounds"... Okay, let's go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_second_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Well, how are you doing here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_second_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Excellent! Well, now the doctor is here again, we definitely will be able to find a vaccine and to overcome the disease! This is extremely important! Just think, what would happen in the long term - if it broke out of the Zone? A search for a vaccine - is a matter of life and death for all mankind! It's not a simple matter, so I'm glad you rescued the doctor!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_second_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Thank you. Happy to help!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_third_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Well, what can you do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_third_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Where have you been?... The poor wretches died in agony. Now it's too late - it's most likely, a cure for the disease, will not be found now! It can now break out of the Zone! You have no idea what this threat, is to all mankind!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_lider_third_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>I pity the poor fellows. Hopefully this disease... will not spread.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Doctor, what is your diagnosis?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Um, well... I think it makes sense to share some thoughts with you. First of all, I want to note that on the basis of my observations, that we can conclude that the infection is not transmitted from person to person, at least - not by airborne droplets. That is, we have practically nothing to fear. I found this out before I was kidnapped by the mercenaries.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Then why such a fuss?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>You see, the situation will not become less critical. I have every reason to believe that the first victim, was a stalker who came into contact with a certain anomalous body, which was an artefact or something like that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>What prompted you to come to this conclusion?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>I spoke to their assistant - the rookie, who protects us. What he said, confirmed my long-standing suspicion of the existence of a "artefact-hive" or in simple words - an artefact that serves as an incubator and as a consequence, is a breeding ground for harmful micro organisms that are likely to mutate and are capable of causing a certain number of dangerous diseases in humans. A long time ago, I put forward a theory of the existence of such an artefact, based on the analysis of various artefacts that impact on the development of strains of some diseases known to science.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Wow, an artefact! Hopefully, if it exists, it's the only one!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>I hope so too, it's indirectly evidenced by the absence of reported epidemics among stalkers; dysentery is not counted. However, my information needs to be checked. This is what I'm getting at: to definitively prove my theory, I need to find the artefact, and study it. Are you ready to go on a quest?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>But what about the patients, what will happen to them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>Don't worry, I have drugs that hinder the development of the disease. However, we can only manufacture the vaccine if we have this "Beehive" artefact, do you understand?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>Let me think about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>I am ready to go!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="izgioy_doctor_third_dialog_phrase_13">
		<text>Well, Marked One! Then start by talking with the man who dragged those guys here. He must know where to find this artefact - they came here without it. I mentioned something about a criminal at the Garbage, try to find out where to look for him. You'll need a protective suit and a special container, as soon as you find it - immediately place it in the container and bring it to me, I already know, what to do with it. But don't try to handle the artefact without a protective suit, Marked One, it would end badly for you. Be sure to wear it before you pick it up. And don't remove the suit until you bring me the artefact, I'm not convinced of the integrity of the container.</text>

		<text>You see that safe in the corner? I've lost lost the combination for it. During my last inventory it seems I found a piece of paper with the combination for the safe, but my batman - that drunken beast lost my briefcase with this piece of paper. It seems he lost it nearby - in the hangar at the entrance to our base, but everyone is afraid to search for it. The hangar doors are locked, you will have to go through the roof. Can you open the safe? I'll owe you one.</text>

		<text>Well done! The combination, what is it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>432. It's tricky, of course, but you better change it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_4">
		<text>I'll change it, I'll change it. What was in there? If you're honest, you'll get a good reward.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_5">
		<text>Nothing, it was empty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_6">
		<text>Well, some junk, a young stalker's gear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_7">
		<text>Okay, fuck it. Here's a reward - it's not much:</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_8">
		<text>Yeah, it's real junk. Okay, hand it over, you can keep the book, it's of no use to me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_9">
		<text>Wait, what about the reward?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_10">
		<text>Here, take it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_11">
		<text>Colonel, do you want the briefcase?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_12">
		<text>Are you kidding? You found it? Give it here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_13">
		<text>Let's assume I won't just give it up, and you give me five pieces.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_14">
		<text>Consider this a normal business deal. Take your five pieces.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_15">
		<text>Here you go, I don't mind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="petr_seif_dialog2_phrase_16">
		<text>You're a good man, Marked One. Here, take a few grenades, they'll come in handy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Your men stripped me of everything, they even threw me in jail.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Who exactly are you accusing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Major Zhivoderov.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Ah, you know him... intelligent fellow. Neither the one you've identified nor any of his men would beat you. Anyway, he's at a meeting today and has already told me everything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>But I wasn't going to steal anything! Something of mine was in that box!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Well, who do think I should believe: the son of a colleague, whom I know from childhood, or you? It's like that. If you really want your confiscated goods returned, I'll give you a chance to prove that they are really yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>I don't need to prove to Duty, what is, or isn't mine...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>Well, do you want to get your stuff back or not?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Of course I do.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>Then listen carefully to what I have to say. The fact is, this area itself is neutral territory. Anyone who calls themselves stalkers can come here and trade, except only the most obvious thugs for whom there's a reward on their heads, and, of course, Freedom... So, there is a problem. A bandit named Caligula has appeared in the Zone recently. At first he traded what little trifle he could steal from the rookies at the Cordon, and then he decided to pull in the "big fish" - he hammered together a gang and started to attack our squads. He'd grab their equipment and loot and the prisoners were sometimes tortured, but more often, they'd be shoot. We started to hunt for him and killed all his accomplices, but we never got Caligula.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>You didn't have enough men?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>Don't interrupt! In short, it's not so simple dealing with this skinhead. The fact is, Caligula has the nerve to come here, to the Bar, drink here and even sell goods stolen from our soldiers!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_13">
		<text>How can this happen?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_14">
		<text>Very simple: Barkeep has some secret agreement with him. We can't just arrest the bandit while he's in the Bar - Barkeep would be offended. He could survive without us, his main clientele - are stalkers with artefacts, we need him more than he needs us... In general, this Caligula is really ruining our lives, and even mocking us. You have to kill him, Marked One.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_15">
		<text>So General, you have decided to make me your proxy. What if Barkeep gets wind of the deal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_16">
		<text>He won't get wind. You have to arrange everything as if it were your own doing, you understand?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_17">
		<text>Not really...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_18">
		<text>You need to somehow offend or insult this Caligula, so he'll challenge you to showdown. Shooting in the Bar is strictly forbidden, therefore you'll have to deal with him in the Arena. That's where you can safely kill him. Nobody will suspect anything.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_19">
		<text>Okay. Where can I find Caligula?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_20">
		<text>No, I won't do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_21">
		<text>He'll be in the 100 Rads Bar. Go and do it, if the bandit dies - you get your things back safely.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_22">
		<text>Where did you get the idea, watching Mad Max movies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_23">
		<text>No, why do you ask?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_dialog_phrase_24">
		<text>The story is similar... Okay, here goes nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>And who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Oh, just looking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>I know your face from somewhere...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>So, get the fuck out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>What did you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>I just remembered, you're the local idiot named Vaska Rooster... Well piss off, your place is in the hen house!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Oh you bitch, you're dead meat! Right, let's go to the Arena now, and sort this out!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>Come on, I'll pluck out your feathers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Choose, scumbag, which weapon do you want to use: pistols, sawn-off shotguns or knives?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kaligula_start_dialog_phrase_10">

	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>What now, general? Caligula is dead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Stalker, I'm very grateful, but listen...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Let me guess: my things are gone to cover expenses?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>Nothing went nowhere, just wait...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>Did Barkeep find out about our affairs?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>No. Zhivoderov got into trouble! He has your stuff.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>What happened with him? I'm only interested purely, because he has my stuff.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>Got into some garbage and now is doomed. My soldiers are trying to get him out, but to no avail.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Just like in the fairy tale, "The Giant Turnip"?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>Consider this, Zhivoderov is the only who knows the location of your items. And if you save the major, you'll also get a reward from me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>I'll help him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_12">
		<text>To hell with your major.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_13">
		<text>Well, I see that you're a real man! An orderly told me about five minutes ago that the major had found something dangerous in the old cracked tower, right across from our base. He's trapped in there as if inside an anomaly. Help him, stalker, he's very valuable to me! My soldiers are there, but for some reason, they can do nothing. Go to him!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_kaligula_reward_dialog_phrase_14">
		<text>Well, as you wish, stalker...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>You're from the General?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Yes, what happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>This, is the problem: the Major entered this fucking tower, but now, he can't get out. I've called and called him, and he doesn't come. Then private Brill went in after him but also, never returned. I went in after Brill, but he was not breathing. If we can't rescue the Major, the General will tear off my skin. Be a man - help me save the Major.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>If the private is dead, what makes you think that the Major is still alive?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>Listen. You can hear moans coming from the top of the tower.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Did you try wearing a suit with psi-protection?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>I tried, but the stupid suit failed, it didn't work!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>Fuck knows what to do now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_1">
		<text>And who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_2">
		<text>I'm the one who knows how to get out the Duty soldier out of the tower.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_3">
		<text>You do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_4">
		<text>I hope you believe what I tell what that extortionist brought on to himself. That bastard tried to rummage through my stash.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_5">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_6">
		<text>I returned to the Bar from Yantar, to have a drink and relax, using the money from the proceeds of my loot. This Zhivoderov, drunk as a lord comes up to me and says, he and his men are guarding me from the bandits, so I should pay him protection money. I ask: "Can I use my loot as payment?" He said that I could. I then told him about my cache in the top tier of the tower. In there, I hid a single unknown artefact, and something else. To the scientists, this artefact was worthless, because it didn't have any properties, but I figured that before the Major worked out what's what, I'd be gone from the Bar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_7">
		<text>Zhivoderov fell for it. So what happened then?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_8">
		<text>He climbed the tower and left his men on lookout. Then they tried to pull him out, but failed. And then you came along... Were you instructed to save him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_9">
		<text>Yes. You said that you know how to do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_10">
		<text>It's necessary to disable the scientific device that he took out of my cache. You see, in addition to the artefact, I also hid an unknown device there, that I stole from the scientists. What are you looking at? They can order a new one, for the price of a pack of smokes... So: I didn't touch the device, I just put it in there. Apparently, the Major rummaged through my cache for the artefact and came across the device and switched it on out of curiosity - and now it's affecting his brain. It's necessary to turn it off, then the field will be gone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_11">
		<text>Why is the Major still alive, and his assistant has died?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_12">
		<text>Fuck knows, maybe because every brain is different. My stalker instinct suggests that this artefact he took from my cache, is somehow protecting him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_13">
		<text>Maybe. What do you advise?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_14">
		<text>It's necessary to switch off the device! There is something else. Although... I have an idea. While I was at the Cordon my friend Tolik, gave me a bottle of the locally brewed moonshine. He said they called it "Kordonovsky". This bastard, packs a punch - it will really numb your brain! So So I'm thinking: fight fire with fire, as they say: drink it and rush to the device. The main thing - is to stall for time, before your brain begins to boil. Well, what will it be?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_15">
		<text>I don't drink!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog1_phrase_16">
		<text>Come on, it can't hurt.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_wounded_help_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>H-help me! Turn it off!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_wounded_help_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Wait a second!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_1">
		<text>Look, how do I turn off this damn device?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_2">
		<text>I wish I knew. There was a manual, but the instructions were so complicated that I used the pages for cigarette papers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>Well, you blockhead! How am I going to turn it off?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_4">
		<text>Wait, calm down. Before I used it all up, I did read something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_5">
		<text>Tell me, what did you understand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_6">
		<text>Although I'm not an electrician, I did realize something. The manual mentioned something about an overload: it said, to prevent it, a certain button must not be depressed, or the specific device will burn out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_7">
		<text>There's a lot of buttons.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_8">
		<text>This is what I remember about what was written: "... for the correct maximum load output it's necessary to press down the buttons alternately, increase the power of the first phase, then go to the second phase alternately pressing all the buttons, except the last one." So, if you click the last button, it will overload.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_9">
		<text>Apparently, it's necessary to press three side buttons in turn, and then click the lower left button, then go back and press all three side buttons again?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_10">
		<text>Are you asking me? I don't actually know. It's just what I read...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tikar_dialog2_phrase_11">
		<text>If not for your greedy hands, this problem wouldn't exist. However, it's in my best interests, to save the Duty soldier in the tower.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog1_phrase_1">
		<text>Listen, do you know how to turn off the unit in the tower?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog1_phrase_2">
		<text>Nah. If I had studied engineering in Kiev, as my parents had always wanted me to, maybe I could suggest something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog2_phrase_1">
		<text>The Major is safe, I shut down the device.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog2_phrase_2">
		<text>Well, thank you, stalker! Listen... Can you tell the General that I helped a little, well a teeny bit, in saving the Major in the tower? He might give me a new weapon, or maybe, award me with a medal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_pomoshnik2_dialog2_phrase_3">
		<text>I understand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_goto_rest_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>Any orders?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="major_goto_rest_dialog_phrase_2">

	</string>
	<string id="major_goto_rest_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>Okay.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_1">
		<text>I rescued your Major.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_2">
		<text>Stalker, you - a real man! I understand your desire to get even with him, what he did to you - was a personal insult. Because you proved yourself by your actions, I now know that you would not steal from Duty caches. By the way, how did it go with Caligula?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_3">
		<text>I guess I know why your soldiers couldn't overcome him: he had an artefact with strong protective properties.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_4">
		<text>It's alright now, he'd dead and can't hurt anyone else.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_5">
		<text>Stalker, I ... I mean our group needs this artefact! We need to pass it on to the scientists, this will help them in the development of protective combat armour. Sell it to me. I give a hundred thousand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>Then get a reward from both me, and Zhivoderov:</text>

	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_7">
		<text>Not enough.</text>

	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_8">
		<text>I agree.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_9">
		<text>Don't be arrogant, that's 10 times more than any rare artefact of that category is worth!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>It has properties that makes it worth more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_11">
		<text>One hundred thousand and our top body armour.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_12">

	<string id="voronin_aftertower_dialog_phrase_13">

	</string>
	<string id="hvost_dialog_phrase_6">
		<text>He went to the north. Not to Freedom, but to undiscovered places. He was constantly tormented, and frequently had nightmares. He was always muttering about the creatures of the Zone, calling them astral beings, the quintessence of the human information field. In general, nonsense. Poor guy... No one really understood him, I thought he went crazy during one of his campaigns. But I saw that in his mind, he really believed it. That subject - we never talked about. Then one day, he packed up and left. He said nothing to anyone, just whispered to me in parting: "I must find him, he will be THERE again, I know it."</text>

	<string id="hvost_dialog_phrase_10">
		<text>To the north, that's all I can say. Only the locals and Kolya know where it is. There are legends about that place, it's called the Dead City. It's dangerous out there, life is worth more than any artefact. Don't think about going there to look for him - you'll disappear as well.</text>

		<text>No, you're not a novice, you're a fool. But why should I care? Go wherever you want.</text>

		<text>Hey, stalker, don't be offended. It's a bad idea - to go after him. But if you've decided, it's your business. If you find him and are able to return - be kind and respectful, let me know if he's alive.</text>

		<text>Yeah, he was killed in the Dead City.</text>

	<string id="hvost_dialog_return_phrase_4">
		<text>So, that's where he went alone. Yes, he liked to take risks. Well, God rest his soul... Did he find what he was looking for?</text>

		<text>I doubt it. I found nothing unusual on him.</text>

	<string id="hvost_dialog_return_phrase_6">
		<text>It's a pity. Well, stalker, thank you for coming. Kolya left a little money with me to look after. He no longer needs it, so you can can have it.</text>

		<text>Well, I'll tell you... We received an order from the mainland - to test an all-purpose weapon. Supposedly, "to fine tune this universal tactical machine of the future to operate under simulated combat conditions." They're bent. What will they use as a simulation - shooting of wild boars at the military post or something? So, here a good old AK-74 will suffice. However, I have an order - so I must obey. The guns look interesting enough, like a normal AK, but it has so many features, that it will blow your mind. Just the sights alone. The boxes of equipment were sent - in the darkness! And I, as usual, am still slowly selling gear to stalkers, I promote, so to speak, unification, he-he. Why don't you take one, and then, in the blink of an eye, you will have a new AK to go. You won't be ridiculed for having a dated weapon.</text>
